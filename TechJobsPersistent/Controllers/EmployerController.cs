              We need to create an Employer object that
                 will pass the properties (Name and Location) from the ViewModel that it's taking in

               Then we need to add this new Employer object that we've crated to the Employers table in the Db
               Then save the changes to the Db
               when all that works we'll redirect to see the list of Employers

          If none of that happens (cause the model isn't valid), then we want to go to the Add view and 
          pass it the information that is in the View Model from the attempted addition


           - - - - 
           PARTS of this are very similar to the [Post] Add in Skills but that's about as close as we get

                ok... so we're passing this About an int like the Skill Controller, but I've told you that search is overkill.
                but lets start with making an Employer object to hold the one we're looking for. 
                and we want to set this object to the Db Employer table

                now when we type "context.Employer." we're gonna get some options. There's one really near the top of that list
                that will take in a parameter and search for it in the Db..... do we think this might help???
